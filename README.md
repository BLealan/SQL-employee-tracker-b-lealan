# SQL-employee-tracker-b-lealan

## Description

This task was to create a "content management system" in order for users to view information stored in an associated database. This is to be accessed via the command line.

Following the concept of modularization and separation of concern, the programme is separated into specific files to handle each aspect of the code, thereby increasing readability. 
- The "questions.js" file contains the options for the user's command line.
- The "schema.sql" file handles the creation of the database and it's tables.
- The ????????? file has MySQL methods in order to handle the user's input and display or alter the appropriate data.
- The index.js file brings together the files and initialises them for the user.
